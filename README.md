website! It contains small (programming) puzzles.

## Structure 
`notebooks` folder contains the solutions in Jupyter notebooks, for each day one.

`data` folder contains files with the generated data. The format is `day<day
number>.txt`, for example `day7.txt`. The files with `_test<number>` as prefix
are copied from the data in the text, and used for testing.

`requirements.txt` contains all used libraries.
